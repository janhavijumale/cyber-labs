# ⚠️ Vulnerabilities, CVEs & Exploit Databases

---

## 📌 What is a Vulnerability?

A **vulnerability** is a flaw or weakness in a system that can be exploited to compromise its confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

### Types of Vulnerabilities
- Buffer overflows
- Injection attacks (SQLi, Command Injection)
- Broken access control
- Insecure deserialization
- Misconfigurations (e.g., open S3 buckets)
- Outdated/Unpatched software

---

## 🆔 What is a CVE?

**CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)** is a public identifier assigned to a known vulnerability.

### 🧠 Example:
CVE-2021-44228
→ Log4Shell vulnerability in Apache Log4j
→ Allowed remote code execution (RCE)
→ Critically impacted global systems


### CVE Format:
CVE-[YEAR]-[ID]
e.g., CVE-2023-12345

CVEs are catalogued to help:
- Researchers share data consistently
- Security teams track patching
- Tools like Nessus/Qualys scan for known CVEs

## 🧰 Key CVE + Exploit Resources

### 🔹 [NVD (National Vulnerability Database)](https://nvd.nist.gov/)
- Maintained by U.S. government (NIST)
- Official source for CVSS scoring and details
- Includes:
  - Base CVSS score (e.g., 9.8/10)
  - Attack vector (local, network)
  - Impact (CIA breakdown)

---

### 🔹 [CVE Details](https://www.cvedetails.com/)
- Easier to browse and filter
- Search by product/vendor (e.g., “Apache”)
- Shows affected versions, patch status

---

### 🔹 [Exploit Database (Exploit-DB)](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
- Maintained by Offensive Security
- Houses public PoCs (Proof of Concept) and full exploits
- You can:
  - Search by CVE
  - Download `.py`, `.sh`, `.c` files
  - Find offensive tools to reproduce known vulnerabilities
- Also includes:
  - Google Dorks (GHDB)
  - Papers and tutorials

---

### 🔹 [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- Search CVEs directly:  
  `CVE-2022-XXXX exploit`, `PoC CVE-2023-YYYY`
- GitHub often hosts:
  - Community-written exploits
  - Automated scanners
  - Detection scripts (YARA, Sigma)
  - CTF writeups using a CVE

**⚠️ WARNING**: Always review the code before running anything. Use sandboxed environments (VM, Kali, Docker).

## 🛡️ Real-World Use Cases

| Use Case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| SOC Analyst | Use CVEs to identify critical alerts from scanner tools (Qualys/Nessus) |
| Pentester | Search exploit-db or GitHub to find public PoCs |
| Blue Team | Use CVE data to patch systems or monitor for exploitation attempts |
| Bug Bounty Hunter | Find unpatched apps with known CVEs |
| Malware Analyst | Check CVE used in exploitation chain |

---

## 📦 Bonus Tools

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| `searchsploit` | CLI tool to search Exploit-DB (preinstalled in Kali) |
| `cve-search` | API tool to query CVEs programmatically |
| `OpenCVE` | Web interface for tracking CVEs in real-time |
| `Vulners.com` | API-friendly CVE search with exploit links |

---

## 💬 Summary

- CVEs are universal vulnerability IDs
- NVD = authoritative details  
- Exploit-DB = PoC for offensive testing  
- GitHub = real code, tools, scripts  
- Use searchsploit & sandbox labs to explore safely
